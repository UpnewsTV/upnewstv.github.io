              UPNEWS App Privacy Policy
            </h3>
            <small>Last Updated June 1, 2016</small>
            <h4>
              1. Introduction
            </h4>
            <p>
              The following Privacy Policy ("Policy") summarizes the various ways that we, UPNEWS LLC, which owns and operates UPNEWS App, uses the information you provide to us or we gather from you while you access or use the website at www.upnews.tv (the "Site"), our mobile applications ("App"), and our currently or future related sites, apps and online services (collectively, the "Services"). It is our goal to provide you with information that is tailored to your individual needs and, at the same time, respect your privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please read this Policy carefully. Your access to or use of any part of the Services will constitute your notice about our collection, use, and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Policy. If you do not wish for us to collect, use, and disclose your information in accordance with this Policy, please do not access or use the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Services and does not apply to any third-party activities, including third-party websites linked from our Services, third-party social networking platforms or features we make available through our Services, or third-party ads displayed on our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of those third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              We consider personal information to be information that can be traced directly back to and that identifies a specific individual or household, such as name, address, email address, and/or phone number, non-exclusively. We do not consider personal information to include information that alone does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual or household.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. We understand, however, that the Services may be sought or used by individuals of any age having an Instagram account, through which our services are accessed. As such, it is important that we emphasize the following: 1) Any use of the Services by a User with a fictitious Instagram profile or that otherwise violates Instagram’s Terms of Service or other term of use is expressly in violation of this Policy and UPNEWS App’s Terms of Service and is not permitted to use the Services.
            </p>

            <p>
              We may, now or in the future, use tools, including third party analytical software, to automatically collect certain anonymous data about your device that does not directly identify you, such as: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to unique or other device identifier; (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as country or region; (v) other similar data as reasonably required by us to enhance the Services and other products and services. We may use this information as described in this Policy, including, for example, to provide you with offers or opportunities based upon your location and shopping goals.
            </p>

These services will share certain personal information with us as described in the sign-in notices or in their privacy policies.

If all or a portion of UPNEWS LLC or its assets are sold or transferred, personal information and other information we have collected may be treated as an asset and transferred in accordance with this Policy.

            <p>
              We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to promote the integrity and confidentiality of personally identifiable information. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
